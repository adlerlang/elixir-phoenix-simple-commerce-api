# My Details 
    Below will explain installation under #  Instructions. Once complete, if you go to http://localhost:4000 it will 
    have example links to choose from and even more simple documentation.
 
    I have used Elixir 1.6.6 version with Postgres and the latest version of Phoenix framework.
    
	As examples for this project, I included queries that vary with the usage of Ecto to display multiple
    ways and at times syntax choices that can be done here.

 	 
# Instructions

To start your Phoenix server:
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Seeding. `mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.


# Assumptions and time acomplishments
    I wanted to do this task in a functional programming language and an mvc so I choose Elixir and Phoenix Framework.
    If I had time, I would have liked to have done range with the Postgrex(spelt right) wrapper to allow access to special postgres
    types using Ecto.type.


#happy with best chances of obtaining their order.
