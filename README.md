.# My Details

Below will explain installation. Once complete, if you go to http://localhost:4000 it will have example links to choose from. 

I have used the Elixir 1.6.6 version with Postgres and the latest version of Phoenix framework.

As examples for this project, I include queries that vary with the usage of Ecto to display multiple ways and at times syntax choices that can be done here.

# Question 9: 
     Erlang and Elixir applications were built to handle soft realtime, concurrent applications.
     Because we are doing one-click ship, its best for the items to be sold first come, first serve checkout until sold out. 
	 Would be best to use machine learning to determine if the item availabilty is a bit further from the customer, and might 
	 take longer for delivery,to utilize resources where items might be more abundant during times of high demand. Possible to 
	 have quantity limits per customer if it is a must. Keep the customer happy while trying your best.
